## Description

This game was made as an assignment for PROG8110 at Conestoga College.

The idea is to run as an android app using only jQuery, HTML and Cordova (Phone Gap).

You can find the main code in index.html (a DIV for each hole) and whackamole.js (handles CSS class changes, click events and keeps the score).
